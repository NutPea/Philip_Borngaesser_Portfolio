# Philip_Borngaesser_Portfolio

Hello nice that you are looking through this portfolio.

Youcan start by opening the Assets/BanStone_Outside Scene. Inside that example Scene you can
find most of my logic. The heart of the game is the movement grid. 
But a good start script would be the player movement controller.
